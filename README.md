# Clustering

I made this application during my Master study, for Data Mining course, with goal to do some practice with clustering.

## Dependencies

The major dependencies of application: 

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Setup 

Assuming you already have the Node.js, you may run the following command: 

```bash
npm install
```

It will setup all dependencies, required to build and run the code.

## Run

To run the code locally, just enter the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:9001.

## Live
